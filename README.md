# Test Repository

This repository contains a simple command line calculator written in Python.

## Usage

Run the calculator in interactive mode:

```bash
python3 calculator.py
```

Or evaluate a single expression from the command line:

```bash
python3 calculator.py "2 + 3 * 4"
```

## Shutdown Scheduler

`shutdown_scheduler.py` provides a simple graphical interface to schedule a system shutdown. Run it with Python and enter the desired time in 24-hour `HH:MM` format.

```bash
python3 shutdown_scheduler.py
```

A window will appear allowing you to specify the shutdown time and schedule it with an OK button.
